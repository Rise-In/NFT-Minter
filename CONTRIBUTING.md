## üõ†Ô∏è How to Contribute
#### 1. Fork the Repository
Start by forking the NFT-Minter repository on GitHub.

#### 2. Clone Your Fork
Once the repository is forked, clone it to your local machine using the following commands:

```
# Using HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/Rise-In/NFT-Minter.git

# Using SSH
git clone git@github.com:Rise-In/NFT-Minter.git
```

#### 3. Create a New Branch
Create a new branch to work on your feature or fix. Use a descriptive branch name for clarity:
```
git checkout -b feature/<your-feature-name>
```
#### 4. Make Changes
Start contributing by making necessary changes to the project. Whether it‚Äôs bug fixes, adding new features, or improving documentation, ensure your code is clean and well-documented.

#### 5. Test Your Changes
Run the project locally to make sure everything works as expected:

- Install the npm packages. You can use any of the three commands mentioned below. If one doesn't work, then move to the next installation command:
command 1: ```npm install```
command 2: ```npm --force install```
command 2: ```npm install --legacy-peer-deps```

- Start the server, using command:
```
npm run start
```

***NOTE: If you want to test, compile, and deploy your smart contract via a user-friendly GUI, then use ThirdWeb. Otherwise, if you are interested in working with the command line (CLI), you can use Hardhat.***

#### 6. Commit Your Changes
After verifying that your changes work, commit them to your branch:
```
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: <your-feature-name>"
```

#### 7. Push to Your Fork
Push your branch to your forked repository:
```
git push origin feature/<your-feature-name>
```

#### 8. Create a Pull Request (PR)
